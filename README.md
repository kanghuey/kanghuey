<h2 align="left">Reflections</h2>

<h3 align="left">Assignment 1</h3>

<p align="left">The visit to NALI2023 and the interview sessions help me learn the course materials better by learning more about the innovations in ICT that can potentially improve our education. I get to see the application of technology in teaching and learning with my own eyes and understand more about each of them through interviews with the NALI2023 participants. Overall, visiting NALI2023 has encouraged me to learn more about our course materials and helps me to grasp more knowledge about technology and information systems.</p>

<h3 align="left">Assignment 2</h3>

<p align="left">Through this talk, I learnt that it is important for us to adapt to the dynamic ICT landscape by nurturing essential skills, fostering teamwork, and embracing a proactive approach to continuous learning. This talk has motivated me to work hard and gain more hands-on experience while I am still studying to prepare for my career in the future.</p>

<h3 align="left">Assignment 3</h3>

<p align="left">From the visit to UTMDigital, I have learnt more about the digital systems and services in UTM, such as UTMWiFi, e-learning platforms, and the UTM Data Centre. We were also able to visit each of the sites in person and learn more about their usage and specialities. It had also taught me ways we can take advantage of newest technology such as the Huawei IdeaHub to make collaborations and communication in our daily lives easier. Overall, it was a fulfilling trip as I am able to gain more knowledge and experience that are helpful for my studies in the future.</p>

<h3 align="left">Assignment 4</h3>

<p align="left">In the next four years, I plan to continuously learn and gain more knowledge such as emerging technologies, programming languages, and frameworks in system development. From the talk, I also realised the importance of gaining practical experience through hands-on practice and internships before securing a job. Apart from programming skills, I will also actively develop and master soft skills such as communication skills, time management skills, and problem-solving skills. I aim to contribute meaningfully to the evolving tech industry as a skilled and proficient system developer.</p>

<h3 align="left">PC Assemble (Lab)</h3>

<p align="left">From the PC sssembling activity, I learnt about the components used in a PC such as hard disks, fans, and power supplies. I also learnt the steps of disassembling and assembling a PC.</p>

<h3 align="left">Design Thinking (Low Fidelity Prototype)</h3>

<p align="left">My goal in regard to my course is to gain enough experience through comprehensive learning and hands-on practice. I aim to equip myself with required skills in the graphics and multimedia software field such as programming and designing skills.<br><br>
By participating in this design thinking process, I have learnt that there is a systematic approach to take when finding solutions for a specific problem. This has improved my problem-solving and communications skills as we all suggested and discussed our own ideas. I have gained a lot of insight through design thinking on how to contribute ideas and turn them into a tangible product, which is a skill that would help me to reach my goal of preparing myself for my future career. <br> <br>
To improve my potential in the industry, it is important for me to actively stay updated on emerging technologies and industry trends. This proactive approach will ensure that my knowledge remains relevant, allowing me to adapt to the evolving landscape of the graphics and multimedia software field. Continuous learning about advancements will not only enhance my skill set but also position me as a valuable asset in the competitive industry I aim to thrive in.</p>
